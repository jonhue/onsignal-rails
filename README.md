# OnSignal on Rails

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/onsignal.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/onsignal) <img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/onsignal-rails.svg?branch=master" />

A OneSignal API wrapper simplifying user targeted cross platform notifications. OnSignal consists of a JavaScript and a Rails API:

* [JavaScript API](https://github.com/jonhue/onsignal): Handle user subscriptions to OneSignal in your frontend code.
* [Rails API](#usage): Attach OneSignal players to user records provided by an authentication solution.

## Usage

Attach OneSignal players to user records provided by an authentication solution.

### Installation

OnSignal works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'onsignal'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install onsignal

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'onsignal', github: 'jonhue/onsignal'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g onsignal

To wrap things up, migrate the changes into your database:

    $ rails db:migrate

### User associations

Define an association in models whose objects are supposed to be associated with OneSignal players. For example `Admin` in `app/models/admin.rb`.

```ruby
class Admin < ApplicationRecord
    onsignal
end
```

Next attach a user object by defining a `set_onsignal_user` method. Let's say model our is named `Admin` and `current_admin` is available at controller level. Just add a method to your `ApplicationController`:

```ruby
def set_onsignal_user
    current_admin if current_admin
end
```

**Note:** If a `current_user` method is available at controller level this method is not required.

You are now able to get OneSignal players for a specific user:

```ruby
a = Admin.first

# All device records of a user
a.devices

# All OneSignal Player ID's of a user returned as an array
a.onesignal_player_ids
```

### Devices

OnSignal introduces a `Device` ActiveRecord model. You can [configure](#configuration) its name. Every record of an associated user class can have multiple devices - one for each device / browser they enabled OneSignal on.

#### Methods

```ruby
d = Device.first

# Returns user associated with device. Can return `nil`.
d.owner

# Returns OneSignal player id
d.onesignal_id

# Returns OneSignal permission ( `granted` / `denied` / `default` )
d.onesignal_permission

# Some timestamps
d.last_used
d.created_at
d.updated_at


# If device is ready to receive notifications
d.onesignal_enabled?

# If device has been disabled to receive notifications
d.onesignal_disabled?

# If device has been set previously to receive notifications or not
d.onesignal_set?
```

#### Helpers

In your controllers and views you can access a `current_onsignal` method that returns the `Device` object of the current OneSignal subscription. If the user browsing your site is not subscribed to OneSignal, `current_onsignal` returns an uncommitted `Device` object with some helpful information, like the `permission` attribute, set.

### Configuration

You can configure OnSignal by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/onsignal.rb`:

```ruby
OnSignal.configure do |config|
    config.device_const = 'Device'
end
```

* `device_const` Name of the constant exposing devices. Takes a constant name (string). Defaults to `'Device'`.
